# 🌍 AquAir – Breathe Smart, Live Safe 

## 📌 Overview  
AquAir is our project for the **2025 NASA Space Apps Challenge**, created by **Team Void_Explorers**.  
It is a concept for a **web-based air quality forecasting app** that integrates NASA’s **TEMPO satellite data**, ground-based air quality measurements, and weather data to provide real-time forecasts and alerts.  

- 🎨 We designed the **UI/UX in Figma** to show how users would interact with the system.  
- 🤖 We implemented a **machine learning model** that predicts the **next-day AQI** using air quality and weather data.  

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
From EarthData to Action: Cloud Computing with Earth Observation Data for Predicting Cleaner, Safer Skies  

**Challenge:** How can we make complex air quality data **simple, accessible, and actionable** for everyday users?

## 🤖 Machine Learning Prototype  
### ML Features:
- Trains on air quality & weather datasets  
- Predicts AQI for the following day  
- Provides outputs for integration into the frontend
  
## 🚀 Future Plans  
- Integrate **NASA TEMPO real-time data**  
- Use **OpenAQ, Pandora, and weather APIs**  
- Backend implementation with **Spring Boot / .NET / Node.js**  
- Frontend with **React + modern UI libraries**  
- Cloud deployment (AWS / GCP / Azure) for scalability  

## 📖 User Guide

### 1. Opening the App
- The homepage displays the **current AQI** for the selected location.  
- AQI categories: **Good, Moderate, Healthy, Unhealthy, Hazardous**.  

### 2. Viewing Forecasts
- Users can view **future AQI predictions** as well as **historical trends**.  

### 3. Changing Location
- Select or change the location to update AQI and forecasts for a different area.  

### 4. Alerts and Safety Guidance
- If the AQI is **Unhealthy** or **Hazardous**, the app provides:  
  - **Health risks** (e.g., vulnerable groups such as children, elderly, or individuals with respiratory conditions)  
  - **Safety tips** (e.g., stay indoors, wear masks, limit outdoor activities)  

### 5. User Experience
- Clean and intuitive interface.  
- Visual cues (colors, icons, graphs) for easy understanding and quick assessment of air quality.
